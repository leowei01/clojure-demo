;; let [symbol value] use symbol to do anything
;; apply only within let expression

;; define will make you lose something, redefine carefully
;; Redefining names in this way changes the meaning of expressions everywhere in a program, without warning.
;; Expressions which relied on the value of a Var could suddenly take on new, possibly incorrect, meanings.
;; Itâ€™s a powerful tool for experimenting at the REPL, and for updating a running program, but it can have unexpected consequences.
;; Good Clojurists use def to set up a program initially, and only change those definitions with careful thought.

;; define a function
(def plus (fn [x] (+ x 1)))

;; multiple arguments
(defn add

;; docstring
(defn launch
